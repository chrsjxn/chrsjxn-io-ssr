## Description

This Polaroid component is a quick abstraction around an
`img`
tag. It renders a lightly processed version of an image, using CSS
[filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter)
to make the image look more vintage.

The Polaroid component also takes an optional effect prop, rendering more
complex effects via CSS gradient overlays.

### Component example

```svelte
<Polaroid src="/__img_path__/profile.jpg" alt="Developer self portrait" effect="drama">
	SF 11/01/2020
</Polaroid>
```

## How it works

### CSS effects

CSS effects in the polaroid component are controlled via the
`effect`
prop, which toggles an extra class on the image wrapper.

Those extra classes are used to control an
`::after`
selector that renders a gradient overlay above the image. (`img`
is a replaced element, so we can't use
`::after`
on it directly. If it weren't for this, I could save a
`div`
ðŸ˜­)

#### Example effect

```css
.vignette::after {
	/* Empty content to show the overlay */
	content: '';

	/* Position over the image, and match its dimensions */
	position: absolute;
	left: 0;
	top: 0;
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0;

	/* Add colors with a partially transparent gradient */
	background: radial-gradient(circle, hsla(36, 76%, 60%, 20%) 60%, hsla(36, 0%, 0%, 75%) 150%);
	mix-blend-mode: darken;
}
```

### A11y

One nice feature of using an
`img`
tag in this component, rather than the CSS
`background`
properties, is that it allows for easy use of a11y attributes like
`alt`!

### Browser support

Does this component work in IE?

Nope! IE doesn't support the
`filter`
CSS that powers part of the effect, but you may be able to achieve a
reasonable fallback with just the gradient overlays.

(Svelte also doesn't currently support IE11 without an extra transpilation
step! But that's mostly a problem with my laziness, instead of a browser
compatibility issue.)
