# On Burnout: Lessons Learned

07/19/2022

Early in 2022, I left my job after almost four years. I told my manager about my
concerns early in 2021, but it took a few more months to recognize them as
burnout. I was happy to earn a late promotion to Staff Engineer, but that
recognition didn't solve the problems I had.

This post is about burnout, and this post is mostly for me. I've started to
regain the joy of coding and learning, but I'm not ready to get back to OKRs,
KPIs, performance reviews, and so many other aspects of professional development
work.

This post will share four lessons I learned about burnout from this experience.
The lessons will link to resources I found while working to understand my burnout,
and they're all connected to personal examples. Your experiences with burnout
and work stress will vary, but burnout is way too common in tech. Even if my lessons
aren't directly relevant to you, I hope that they help you reflect on your own
work.

## Lesson 1: Burnout is not individual

> While I was already working a lot, I would still do on-call shifts and take
> emergency calls outside of my scheduled working hours because I wanted the
> team to be successful. While I was helping the team there was a high personal
> cost to constantly taking emergency calls and never really taking a break from
> work.

Individual responsibility is a wonderful thing, but it's critical to recognize
situations that are outside of one person's control. The above story isn't mine,
but the details definitely resonate. And individual action cannot solve the
central issues in a situation like this. If one team member starts setting
better boundaries, what happens to the emergency calls they were handling
before?

That isn't to say that individual accommodations don't help! When I first called
it burnout, my manager helped me step back from my recruiting responsibilities
for a few months. I stepped back from mentorship and I scheduled multiple
vacations. Those changes gave me mental energy to see my concerns more clearly,
and to focus on the most critical work. But the bigger problems remained
unsolved.

Despite rising awareness and concern about burnout as a workplace issue [(1)][1],
it is still extremely easy to find resources that stress individual solutions,
even from trusted institutions. Maybe yoga or meditation [(2)][2] will give you
the strength to keep showing up, but they won't solve issues with how your team
organizes work and manages emergencies.

## Lesson 2: Overwork is not the only concern

> Our actual workload accounts for only a portion of the burden we experience at
> work. More than half of respondents in one survey said that their primary
> source of work-related stress didn’t have to do with their workload; rather,
> they cited stressors such as people issues, juggling work and personal lives,
> and lack of job security.

Overwork obviously is a problem. The quote leading into the first lesson is from
an employee working long hours and taking additional, out-of-band responsibilities
on top. It's easy to find sources that still treat burnout and overwork as
equivalent [(3)][3].

But that wasn't one of the factors leading to my burnout. I had clear boundaries
about my work time, and enough seniority—or enough "not my problem" energy—to
stick to them. People even appreciated the clarity of "I don't work weekends
without prior planning, but I _can_ be flexible if you give me advanced notice."

The Mayo Clinic recognizes five other causes of burnout [(2)][2] and other
sources identify more [(4)][4], including a lack of control and any number of
indicators of a dysfunctional workplace. I don't have great research on how
common each factor is, but it seems telling that many sources list other
causes first [(2)][2] [(5)][5] [(6)][6].

For me, a lot of the initial stress
came from irrelevant or underappreciated work. My team operated with a
very split focus. It was very common for my work to be blocked because the people
who could unblock it had other priorities. That friction added stress. And
trying to solve the underlying problem without the right influence or authority
added even more stress.

## Lesson 3: Do the work that matters

> Chris has played a tremendous role in elevating our web engineers over the
> past year. Since immediately after starting he's been leading our internal
> web meetups, helping guide how we hire web engineers, and been a tremendous
> mentor to many on the team and across the org. Leading by example with
> integrity and empathy, he gets the job done.

There are probably as many ways to understand this lesson as there are people
working in your company. Google's People Operations team identified meaning and
impact of work as two of the key factors of successful teams [(7)][7]. Other
sources highlight strong motivation as a mitigation for stress or mental
fatigue [(8)][8] [(9)][9].

This was always very clear to me on the job. Tasks like mentorship, community
building, and feedback on code reviews were easy to do. Times when I went
above and beyond, or happily accepted additional responsibility, were always for
work that benefited the whole web community.

The contrast with other work was obvious. I worked on a number of projects
where nobody was invested in the outcome. I'm still not sure how those projects
were picked as critical priorities, but it took much more discipline for me
to make any progress. And that discipline takes a toll if that kind of work is
common.

Coming at this from another angle, the reactions from other employees when I
announced I was quitting are telling. Multiple teammates told me that they
wished we'd had more chances to work together, because the projects I did were
isolated from them. Employees on other teams, my friends and my mentees, shared
a ton of gratitude for the more communal work I did. My team wasn't tracking it,
but it was obvious what work mattered the most. The disconnect from my team's
priorities was a problem.

## Lesson 4: You can't change what you can't change

> Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to
> change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

I'll admit, I'm always a little disappointed when old Catholic school prayers
are relevant to my life. The reality of work is that there will always be
situations outside of your control. Maybe a project has a strict legal deadline
that can't be shifted. Maybe a coworker isn't open to feedback, even when their
approach is causing problems for the team.

I spent a lot of time on a variation of that second one. What do
you do if your team agrees with you about a problem, likes your suggestion for
solving it, but doesn't follow through?

To be more concrete, my team had a bad tendency to start more projects than
we had team members, and to lean on single contributors for efficiency.
Those projects took longer than expected and often needed to cut scope to avoid
even more delays. The cost of supporting our work was high, because only a few
team members had the right knowledge to help users.
The solution seemed obvious: work together and commit to fewer projects.
But even when the team agreed to more collaboration, our ultimate plan
still called for me to split focus between multiple solo projects.

This is why this post is lessons I learned about burnout, not solutions. I didn't
have the tools or the influence to change the way my team worked. With limited
options, I made the only change that seemed possible. I quit.

## tl;dr; What you can take away from this

These are obviously my experiences, and they're tied to the work I did and the
struggles I had. But burnout is a bigger issue than just me and my
former team. So what can you take away from this?

If you're a manager or a leader, learn the many causes of burnout and check in
with your people. The effects of burnout are individual, but the causes and
solutions are likely tied to a larger structure. Even with the best intentions,
individual changes won't solve structural problems.

If you're an employee, you should know the symptoms of burnout and be comfortable
discussing them with your manager. If you feel burned out and the problems
are outside of your control, you should conserve your mental energy and think
about what options are truly available to you.

As for me, hindsight is a boon. Clear goals, invested stakeholders, and meaningful
collaboration: these aren't nice-to-haves. These are key pieces of teams and
projects that allow me to do my best work. Understanding these needs—and the
consequences of not having them met—means I have better tools to advocate for
myself. Even if I'm not ready to get back to the grind yet, these tools will help.
